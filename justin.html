        <p>Justin Drew Bieber is a Canadian singer. Bieber is recognized for his genre-melding musicianship and has played an influential role in modern-day popular music. He was discovered by American record executive Scooter Braun and signed with RBMG Records in 2008 and soon establishing himself as a teen idol.
            Bieber achieved commercial success with his teen pop-driven debut studio album, My World 2.0 (2010), which debuted atop the US Billboard 200, making him the youngest solo male act to top the chart in 47 years.[4] The album spawned the internationally successful single "Baby", which became one of the best selling singles of all time in the US.[5] His second studio album, Under the Mistletoe (2011), became the first Christmas album by a male artist to debut at number one in the US.[6] Bieber experimented with dance-pop in his third studio album, Believe (2012), and went on to become the first artist in history with five US number-one albums by the age of 18.[7] Between 2013 and 2014, Bieber was involved in multiple controversies and legal issues, which had a drastic impact on his public image.[8]

In 2015, Bieber explored EDM as a lead vocalist on Jack Ü's "Where Are Ü Now", which won the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Recording.[9][10] The song's musical direction played an instrumental role in his fourth studio album, Purpose, which produced three US number-one singles: "Love Yourself", "Sorry", and "What Do You Mean?". He became the first artist in history to occupy the entire top three of the UK Singles Chart.[11] Bieber diversified on numerous collaborations between 2016 and 2017, including "I'm the One" and his remix to "Despacito" — both reaching number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 a week apart, making him the first artist in history to chart new number-one songs in consecutive weeks.[12] "Despacito" was named the greatest Latin song of all time by Billboard and earned Bieber his career-first Latin Grammy Award. In 2019, he released a country collaboration with Dan + Shay, "10,000 Hours", which won the Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance.[13]

In 2020, Bieber released his R&B-led fifth studio album, Changes, which debuted at number one in both the UK and US, and a standalone duet with Ariana Grande, "Stuck with U", which debuted atop the US Billboard Hot 100.[14] Bieber returned to his pop roots on his sixth studio album, Justice (2021). It produced the worldwide hit "Peaches" and debuted atop the US Billboard 200, making him the youngest soloist to have eight US number-one albums, a record held previously by Elvis Presley since 1965.[15] The same year, Bieber released "Stay" with the Kid Laroi, which became his eighth US number-one single.[16]

Bieber is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 150 million records worldwide. He is credited with three Diamond certifications from the RIAA for "Baby", "Sorry" and "Despacito". He has received numerous accolades, including two Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy Award, eight Juno Awards, two Brit Awards, one Bambi Award, 26 Billboard Music Awards, 18 American Music Awards, 22 MTV Europe Music Awards (the most wins for any artist), 23 Teen Choice Awards (the most wins for a male individual), and 33 Guinness World Records. Time named Bieber one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, and he was included on Forbes' list of the top ten most powerful celebrities in 2011, 2012, and 2013.[17]
